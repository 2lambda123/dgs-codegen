# DGS Code Generation Plugin

The DGS Code Generation plugin generates code during your projectâ€™s build process based on your GraphQL schema file. The
plugin generates the following:

* Data types for types, input types, enums and interfaces.
* A DgsConstants class containing the names of types and fields
* A type safe query API that represents your queries
* Example data fetchers

# Getting Started

To get started with the DGS Framework the [getting started guide](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/getting-started/) is
great starting place. Documentation for DGS Code Generation can be
found [here](https://netflix.github.io/dgs/generating-code-from-schema/).
